1) install matugen to dynamicaly generate colors
2) place all the folders in the ~/.config folder
3) make a "Wallpapers" and "Icons" folders and populate it with your own SVGs
4) make sure to run "sudo pacman -S qt6-5compat" to use the GraphicalEffects library in quickshell

###---Hey---###
If you don't want to use matugen and go with pywal, I have added a template file; put it in the ~/.config/wal/template folder and run the "wal -i <path>" command, it will generate the template file in the .cache pywal directory.

I have also added a shell script that creates symlinks(hard) for the .cache color files generated to the respective .config app directory.

don't be afraid, if you break anything just reinstall arch ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
